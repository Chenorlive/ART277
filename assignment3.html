        <h2>Travelling in Depression</h2>

        <p>
          When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my
          grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now
          been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique
          learning experience.

          At five, I <a href="https://starzit.com/">marveled</a> at the Eiffel
          Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of
          Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian
          waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient,
          megalithic structure of Stonehenge and

          walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the
          thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in
          <a href="https://starzit.com/">Starz University</a>.
        </p>

          It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became
          interested in language.

        <p>
          It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation.
          I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides
          was. But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with
          more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.

          In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its
          similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for
          example, is béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the
          same.This was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehension
          more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue
          when I forget how to say something in Spanish.

          Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I
          studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was
          missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words
          were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire
          and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山),
          which means volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the
          characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.
